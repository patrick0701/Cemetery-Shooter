This is a shooter practice game. My aim is to create a spooky, but dreamy and fun environment for the user to enter in. It is set in a cemetery and the user is able to pick between an axe, a handgun and pistol to practice shooting while being on his/her nerve the entire time.

Sound Track: I used the famous Hungarian song “szomorú vasárnap,” otherwise known as “the suicide music.” It featured in the movie “Gloomy Sunday” and I believe it symbolized the fragility of humanity under Nazi operation of Hungary. The Hungarians fought to the last with the Nazis, unable to withdraw like its neighbors, and people were dying against their wills when Budapest became a doomed city with sinking into inevitable death. It fits well with the cemetery scene. I made it a loop in the background with scripts. 

Prefabs: I created features such as tombstones, bloody cross, ghost statues and coffins. These are the first things the user would see. These all worked to get the user into the scene. The user is to grab a weapon and shoot at the target placed on one of the ghost statues. He/she may also explore the scene, and climb the hill to get a good view of the cemetery. 

Background: I used dusty modes effects and fog lit by lights  to make the scene appear more dreamy. 

Weapons: Pistol, axe and handgun. They all featured realistic mesh, good sounds and I positioned them well so that they are easy to grab. 

Controllers: I used a blue raycast because I didn’t want the color to take away any attention from the user’s surroundings. I also made it possible to carry a gun while teleporting. 



If given more time, I plan to add more features such as realistic zombies, an integrated chatbot that randomly spawns spooky messages (scraped from forums), and a multiplayer mode made available. 

This will be a hack of fun when you turn off the lights and play it on a Friday night.
